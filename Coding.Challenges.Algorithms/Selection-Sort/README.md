# Selection Sort

The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. This process is repeated for the remaining unsorted portion until the entire list is sorted.

Input format:

- The first line contains integer n the size of the array.
- Each of the next n lines contains an integer with value from array.

Input sample:
```
3
12
44
7
```


Output:
```
7, 12, 44
```
