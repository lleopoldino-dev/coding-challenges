# Array Manipulation

Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, for each operation add a value to each the array element between two given indices, inclusive. Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum value in the array.

Input format:

- The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m, the size of the array and the number of operations.
- Each of the next m lines contains three space-separated integers a, b and k, the left index, right index and summand.

Input sample:
```
5 3
1 2 100
2 5 100
3 4 100
```


Output:
```
200
```
