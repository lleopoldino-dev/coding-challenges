# Cycle Detection

A linked list is said to contain a cycle if any node is visited more than once while traversing the list. Given a pointer to the head of a linked list, determine if it contains a cycle. If it does, return 1. Otherwise, return 0.

Input format:

- Linked list following the structure in .cs file.

Input sample:
```
head (1) refers to the list of nodes 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> NULL
```


Output:
```
1
```
